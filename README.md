## What's BlindChess assistant ?
Blindchess assistant is an application under development, allowing people with a visual disability to learn chess, the rules, and the pieces movement, with the help of a vocal assistant.

## Fueled by Swift and SwiftSpeech

BlindChessAssistant relies on the SwiftSpeech package to onboard vocal interaction with your phone.

## Language support
At the moment, BlindChessAssistant only supports french language. We are looking forward on working on an english version realy soon
